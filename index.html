        <h3>EMPATHIZE PHASE</h3>
          <p> In the early research phase, we knew it was vital to capitalize on learning our users. From learning their thought process and motivations to their goal and pain points. We found it absolute necessity to create an app isn’t just useful, but an actual tool built for users from the users. We decided to interview users one on one and via survey to get maximum data. Interviewees were catagorized by several open demographics. Ages: 18-60, Occupation: Student or Employee, Gender: Male or Female, etc.

        <p> We used the total of interviews and our affinity diagram to develop a viable and accurate user persona of a potential user. We wanted to be sure that Joaquin Silva has a relatable story that many users have faced and can relate to. Our team went down the line from motivations, pain points, to favorite brands. We didn’t want a

      <h3>USER INSIGHT</h3>
    <p> Joaquin, a dad who struggled with obesity as a child, needs to feel more in control and reduce food waste because he feels defeated when he throws food away in aiming to lead his family towards a more health conscious lifestyle. This will support his effort in preventing obesity from happening in his family. </p>

    <h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>
  <p> FooDBR is being developed to lower food waste by providing expiring food reminders based on a shopping list the user can input and recommending recipes with the food on hand. Currently, the market does not have a single resource where users can track food expiration dates and search for recipes with existing ingedients. By filling this market gap where we can reduce waste food and excessive purchases.  What features and functions can we incorperate that ensure our users are successful in waste reduction, exploring new healthy recipes by tracking shopping lists, food outcomes and app community recipes?</p>

  <h3>User Flow</h3>

  </div>
<p> Once the tasks list were completed. We developed a user flow to distinguish where user inputs were needed in the process.  The user flow had a couple of iterations between initial to final user flow.  Iterations were based off of the user prototype testing.

  <h3>Sketches </h3>
  <div class="sk-pic picmargin">
    
  </div>
<p> This was crucial point where we brainstormed and sketched as many wireframes and concepts as we could before digitalizing the low-high fidelity wireframes to get a general idea of layout and features </p>
</div>

<div class="statement rs">
  <h3>Iterations Made Based on User Testing</h3>
<p> We made huge changes from several user test. We changed the whole concept of the design and interface from our recorded test. We were able to find the problems that users were facing and could step forward for their need.

  <h3>V1 Low-Fi Wireframe</h3>
<p> We really start to refine and develop UI design with the direction of this layout in this low fi wireframe</p>

<p> I wanted to create a design that was clean and modern.  I longed for the logo to be reminiscent of the produce and the grocery stores. I tested multiple colors, but the green stood out the most. Not necessarily as a color within its self, but as a cognitive response.

  <h3>Final Thoughts / Conclusion</h3>
<p> Testing several users throughout different times in the project 
  provides hidden insights and expands upon the usability and 
  trajectory of the app.  Initial testing at the beginning with a 
  
  sketch wireframe provides an abundance amount of feedback 
  early in the design. 
  
  Competitor analysis allows us to see the gaps in the market.
